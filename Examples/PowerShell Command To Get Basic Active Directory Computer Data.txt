# The PowerShell command below can be provided to a domain administrator to obtain computers within Active Directory
# Although PoSh-ACME can pull hosts easily from within the GUI, this command is useful when access is limited or you want it early
# All active directory computers (servers and hosts) are save them as a CSV file.
# The results allow endpoints within PoSh-AMCE to be viewed/sorted by their Organizational Units and/or Operating Systems.
# The $DomainController variable should be replace with the domain controllers hostname
# The CSV file is saved to the same directory that the command is executed within
# The contents of the file can be imported into PoSh-ACME using the "Import from .CSV" button, any duplicate hostnames will not be addded
# You can also just rename the csv file to "Computer List TreeView (Saved).csv" if it is your initial import


# The command:
$DomainController = 'localhost'

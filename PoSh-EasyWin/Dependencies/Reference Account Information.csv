Administrator,"The default local Administrator account is a user account for the system administrator. Every computer has an Administrator account (SID S-1-5-domain-500, display name Administrator). The Administrator account is the first account that is created during the Windows installation.
The Administrator account has full control of the files, directories, services, and other resources on the local computer. The Administrator account can create other local users, assign user rights, and assign permissions. The Administrator account can take control of local resources at any time simply by changing the user rights and permissions.
The default Administrator account cannot be deleted or locked out, but it can be renamed or disabled.
In Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, Windows setup disables the built-in Administrator account and creates another local account that is a member of the Administrators group. Members of the Administrators groups can run apps with elevated permissions without using the Run as Administrator option. Fast User Switching is more secure than using Runas or different-user elevation.","Windows 10, Server 2019, Server 20216",,,"Even when the Administrator account has been disabled, it can still be used to gain access to a computer by using safe mode. In the Recovery Console or in safe mode, the Administrator account is automatically enabled. When normal operations are resumed, it is disabled.","By default, the Administrator account is installed as a member of the Administrators group on the server. It is a best practice to limit the number of users in the Administrators group because members of the Administrators group on a local server have Full Control permissions on that computer.

The Administrator account cannot be deleted or removed from the Administrators group, but it can be renamed.
","Because the Administrator account is known to exist on many versions of the Windows operating system, it is a best practice to disable the Administrator account when possible to make it more difficult for malicious users to gain access to the server or client computer.

You can rename the Administrator account. However, a renamed Administrator account continues to use the same automatically assigned security identifier (SID), which can be discovered by malicious users. 

As a security best practice, use your local (non-Administrator) account to sign in and then use Run as administrator to accomplish tasks that require a higher level of rights than a standard user account. Do not use the Administrator account to sign in to your computer unless it is entirely necessary.

In comparison, on the Windows client operating system, a user with a local user account that has Administrator rights is considered the system administrator of the client computer. The first local user account that is created during installation is placed in the local Administrators group. However, when multiple users run as local administrators, the IT staff has no control over these users or their client computers.

In this case, Group Policy can be used to enable secure settings that can control the use of the local Administrators group automatically on every server or client computer."
Anonymous Logon,"Whether they're viewing a Web page without entering a password or connecting to a Windows share through a null session, anonymous users are not required to enter a login credential for a network resource.
The ""anonymous"" logon has been part of Windows domains for a long time. In short, it is the permission that allows other computers to find yours in the Network Neighborhood, find what file shares or printers you are sharing, etc. It is also why Windows admins say never to grant share permissions to the ""Everyone"" group (unless you know what you are doing), because ""Everyone"" also includes ANONYMOUS.",,,,"If you're running a Web server, you should see numerous NT Authority/Anonymous Event ID 538 (Logoff) and 540 (Logon) entries in the security log of your event viewer. These entries are normal; your Web user account is proxying a request from a user to view Web pages.

However, you should not see NT Authority/Anonymous event ID 528 (Logon) Type 3 on your file servers and workstations. These events indicate that an anonymous user has successfully viewed or connected to a network share.",,

DWM-2,"Desktop Window Manager (DWM) 
[Reference DWN-1] 
In this case there are two dwm.exe processes running on the system. This is due to the fact that two users are connected to this computer with Windows at the same time (local session and remote logon via RDP). Accordingly, to process the graphic representation of the desktop for each user, the system launches a separate process dwm.exe (DWM-1, DWM-2)",,,,,,
DWM-3,"Desktop Window Manager (DWM)

Though unlikely, you may even see higher number DWMs.",,,,,,
Guest,"The Guest account is disabled by default on installation. The Guest account lets occasional or one-time users, who do not have an account on the computer, temporarily sign in to the local server or client computer with limited user rights. By default, the Guest account has a blank password. Because the Guest account can provide anonymous access, it is a security risk. For this reason, it is a best practice to leave the Guest account disabled, unless its use is entirely necessary.

In addition, the guest user in the Guest account should not be able to view the event logs. After the Guest account is enabled, it is a best practice to monitor the Guest account frequently to ensure that other users cannot use services and other resources, such as resources that were unintentionally left available by a previous user.","Windows 10, Server 2019, Server 20216",,,"When enabling the Guest account, only grant limited rights and permissions. For security reasons, the Guest account should not be used over the network and made accessible to other computers.","By default, the Guest account is the only member of the default Guests group (SID S-1-5-32-546), which lets a user sign in to a server. On occasion, an administrator who is a member of the Administrators group can set up a user with a Guest account on one or more computers.
",
HelpAssistant,"The HelpAssistant account is a default local account that is enabled when a Remote Assistance session is run. This account is automatically disabled when no Remote Assistance requests are pending.
HelpAssistant is the primary account that is used to establish a Remote Assistance session. The Remote Assistance session is used to connect to another computer running the Windows operating system, and it is initiated by invitation. For solicited remote assistance, a user sends an invitation from their computer, through e-mail or as a file, to a person who can provide assistance. After the user’s invitation for a Remote Assistance session is accepted, the default HelpAssistant account is automatically created to give the person who provides assistance limited access to the computer. The HelpAssistant account is managed by the Remote Desktop Help Session Manager service.","Windows 10, Server 2019, Server 20216","S-1-5-<domain>-13 (Terminal Server User)
S-1-5-<domain>-14 (Remote Interactive Logon)",,"The SIDs that pertain to the default HelpAssistant account include:
     - SID: S-1-5-<domain>-13, display name Terminal Server User. This group includes all users who sign in to a server with Remote Desktop Services enabled. Note that, in Windows Server 2008, Remote Desktop Services are called Terminal Services.
     - SID: S-1-5-<domain>-14, display name Remote Interactive Logon. This group includes all users who connect to the computer by using a remote desktop connection. This group is a subset of the Interactive group. Access tokens that contain the Remote Interactive Logon SID also contain the Interactive SID.

For the Windows Server operating system, Remote Assistance is an optional component that is not installed by default. You must install Remote Assistance before it can be used.","Domain Guests

LocalService,"A Default local system account
The LocalService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.
This account can be specified in a call to the CreateService and ChangeServiceConfig functions.

While the security subsystem localizes this account name, the SCM does not support localized names. Therefore, you will receive a localized name for this account from the LookupAccountSid function, but the name of the account must be NT AUTHORITY\LocalService when you call CreateService or ChangeServiceConfig, regardless of the locale, or unexpected results can occur.","Windows 10, Server 2019, Server 20216",The user SID is created from the SECURITY_LOCAL_SERVICE_RID value.,"SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME (disabled)

NetworkService,"A Default local system account
The NetworkService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. A service that runs in the context of the NETWORK SERVICE account presents the computer's credentials to remote servers. This account is not recognized by the security subsystem, so you cannot specify its name in a call to the LookupAccountName function.

System,"A Default local system account
The SYSTEM account is used by the operating system and by services that run under Windows. There are many services and processes in the Windows operating system that need the capability to sign in internally, such as during a Windows installation. The SYSTEM account was designed for that purpose, and Windows manages the SYSTEM account’s user rights. It is an internal account that does not show up in User Manager, and it cannot be added to any groups.
On the other hand, the SYSTEM account does appear on an NTFS file system volume in File Manager in the Permissions portion of the Security menu. By default, the SYSTEM account is granted Full Control permissions to all files on an NTFS volume. Here the SYSTEM account has the same functional rights and permissions as the Administrator account.
Note   To grant the account Administrators group file permissions does not implicitly give permission to the SYSTEM account. The SYSTEM account's permissions can be removed from a file, but we do not recommend removing them.","Windows 10, Server 2019, Server 20216",,,,,

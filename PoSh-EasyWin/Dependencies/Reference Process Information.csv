Some malware disguises itself as wscript.exe, particularly when not located in the C:\Windows\System32 folder. Therefore, you should check the wscript.exe process on your PC to see if it is a threat.
- Performing this task does not require you to have administrative credentials. Therefore, as a security best practice, consider performing this task as a user without administrative credentials.
- To open a command prompt, on the Start screen, type cmd, and then click command prompt.
- Each parameter is optional; however, you cannot specify script arguments without specifying a script. If you do not specify a script or any script arguments, wscript.exe displays the Windows Script Host Settings dialog box, which you can use to set global scripting properties for all scripts that wscript.exe runs on the local computer.
- The /t parameter prevents excessive running of scripts by setting a timer. When the time exceeds the specified value, wscript interrupts the script engine and ends the process.
- Windows script files usually have one of the following file name extensions: .wsf, .vbs, .js."

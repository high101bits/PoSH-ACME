WinPmem is a free, actively developed, opensource forensic memory acquisition tool for Windows. It supports Windows XP to Windows 8, both 32 and 64 bit architectures. It can produce raw dumps as well as dumps in crashdump format (for analysis with Volatility or windbg). It supports output to STDOUT for piping the dump through tools like netcat or ssh. WinPmem can be used together with the Volatility Technology Preview to analyse a live windows system for live response and triaging.

A potential criticality of High means that one occurrence of the event should be investigated. 

A potential criticality of Medium or Low means that these events should only be investigated if 
they occur unexpectedly or in numbers that significantly exceed the expected baseline in a measured 
period of time. 

All organizations should test these recommendations in their environments before creating alerts 
that require mandatory investigative responses. Every environment is different, and some of the 
events ranked with a potential criticality of High may occur due to other harmless events.

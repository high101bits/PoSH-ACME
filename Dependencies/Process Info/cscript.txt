Known Malicious Uses:

Notes: The Windows Script Host has a second host front-end application called CScript (CScript.exe), which enables you to run scripts from the command line. In its simplest form, you launch CScript and use the name of the script file (and its path, if required) as a parameter, as in this example: cscript myscript.vbs

Remarks
- Performing this task does not require you to have administrative credentials. Therefore, as a security best practice, consider performing this task as a user without administrative credentials.
- To open a command prompt, on the start screen, type cmd, and then click command prompt.
- Each parameter is optional; however, you cannot specify script arguments without specifying a script. If you do not specify a script or any script arguments, cscript.exe displays the cscript.exe syntax and the valid host options.
- The /T parameter prevents excessive running of scripts by setting a timer. When the run time exceeds the specified value, cscript interrupts the script engine and ends the process.
- Windows script files usually have one of the following file name extensions: .wsf, .vbs, .js.
- You can set properties for individual scripts. See Related Topics for more information.
- Windows Script Host can use .wsf script files. Each .wsf file can use multiple scripting engines and perform multiple jobs.
- If you double-click a script file with an extension that has no association, the Open With dialog box appears. select wscript or cscript, and then select Always use this program to open this file type. This registers wscript.exe or cscript as the default script host for files of this file type.
- You can set properties for individual scripts. See additional References for more information.
- Windows Script Host can use .wsf script files. Each .wsf file can use multiple scripting engines and perform multiple jobs.

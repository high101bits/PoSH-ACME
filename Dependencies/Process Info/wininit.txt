WININIT kick-starts Windows by launching processes to handle security (LSASS), run drivers and services (SERVICES).
It’s launched from an instance of SMSS, and won’t have any parent, but should be the parent for services.exe and lsass.exe.
There's one instance only, running as SYSTEM, in session 0.

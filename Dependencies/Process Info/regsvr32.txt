Description:  It registers DLLs into the Windows Registry, allowing other software to access the library as needed.	

Known Malicious Uses: Squiblydoo

Notes: regsrv32.exe allows for JScript or VBScript to be injected into DLLs, Living off the Land attacks can also evade Microsoft’s AppLocker and avoid easy spotting in the event logs.

The regsvr32’s /i parameter, which is used to trigger any initial installation processing, accepts a COM scriptlet. In other the words, an administrator can insert dynamic code when the DLL sets itself up.

Microsoft did respond, in Windows 10 at least, with a way to detect  (not block) Squiblydoo – which it calls process hollowing — through an update to its Windows Defender ATP.

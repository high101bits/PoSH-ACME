Description: Windows Script Host provides an environment in which users can execute scripts in a variety of languages that use a variety of object models to perform tasks.

Known Malicious Uses:

Notes: The malware programmers or cyber criminals write different types of malicious programs and name it as wscript.exe to damage the software and hardware. Some malware disguises itself as wscript.exe, particularly when not located in the C:\Windows\System32 folder. Therefore, you should check the wscript.exe process on your PC to see if it is a threat.

Remarks:
- Performing this task does not require you to have administrative credentials. Therefore, as a security best practice, consider performing this task as a user without administrative credentials.
- To open a command prompt, on the Start screen, type cmd, and then click command prompt.
- Each parameter is optional; however, you cannot specify script arguments without specifying a script. If you do not specify a script or any script arguments, wscript.exe displays the Windows Script Host Settings dialog box, which you can use to set global scripting properties for all scripts that wscript.exe runs on the local computer.
- The /t parameter prevents excessive running of scripts by setting a timer. When the time exceeds the specified value, wscript interrupts the script engine and ends the process.
- Windows script files usually have one of the following file name extensions: .wsf, .vbs, .js.
- If you double-click a script file with an extension that has no association, the Open With dialog box appears. Select wscript or cscript, and then select Always use this program to open this file type. This registers wscript.exe or cscript.exe as the default script host for files of this file type.
- You can set properties for individual scripts. See Windows Script Host overview for more information.
- Windows Script Host can use .wsf script files. Each .wsf file can use multiple scripting engines and perform multiple jobs.

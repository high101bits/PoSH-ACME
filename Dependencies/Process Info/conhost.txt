Description:
It’s not an essential part of Windows launch, but you might stillfind the Console Window Host running on your system.
This isn’t likely to be impersonated by malware, so as long as it’s running from \Windows\System32 and signed by Microsoft then the process itself is going to be safe.
What’s more interesting is why it’s been launched, as the presence of CONHOST indicates some console-based activity. That might be completely safe and legitimate – you’ve just opened a command window, an application has used the shell for something – but take a closer look anyway. Which process was the parent, what’s the user account, when was it launched?

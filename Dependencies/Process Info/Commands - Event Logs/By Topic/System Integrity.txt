4612(S): Internal resources allocated for the queuing of audit messages have been exhausted, leading to the loss of some audits.
4615(S): Invalid use of LPC port.
4618(S): A monitored security event pattern has occurred.
4816(S): RPC detected an integrity violation while decrypting an incoming message.
5038(F): Code integrity determined that the image hash of a file is not valid. The file could be corrupt due to unauthorized modification or the invalid hash could indicate a potential disk device error.
5056(S): A cryptographic self-test was performed.
5062(S): A kernel-mode cryptographic self-test was performed.
5057(F): A cryptographic primitive operation failed.
5060(F): Verification operation failed.
5061(S, F): Cryptographic operation.
6281(F): Code Integrity determined that the page hashes of an image file are not valid. The file could be improperly signed without page hashes or corrupt due to unauthorized modification. The invalid hashes could indicate a potential disk device error.
6410(F): Code integrity determined that a file does not meet the security requirements to load into a process.

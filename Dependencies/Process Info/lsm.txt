Number of Instances:	One

User Account:	Local System

Start Time:	Within seconds of boot time

Description:	Local Session Manager handles terminal services, including Remote Desktop sessions as well as additional local sessions via Fast User Switching. It communicates with smss.exe to start new sessions. Smss in turn creates an additional csrss.exe and winlogon.exe to support the new session. Only on instance of this process should occur prior to Windows 8 and it shold never have child processes. Beginning with Windows 8, this functionality was moved to a service, utilizing a service DLL named lsm.dll (lsm.exe no longer exists).

Manages the state of terminal server sessions on the local machine. Sends the requests to smss.exe to start new sessions.

It should not have child processes

Receives logon/off, shell start and termination, connect/disconnects from a session, and lock/unlock desktop

I have not personally seen malware try and impersonate LSM.exe, but there is always a first so keep your eyes open.

When you get comfortable with everything, dig deeper and check...
......what modules are typically loaded for each process
......to see if processes that should not be connecting out to the internet are not
......process privileges
......investigate processes running inside %temp%, root of %appdata%, %localappdata%, recycle bin, etc.
......if wscript.exe is running, determine why and check its command line arguments
......if rundll32.exe is running, determine why and check its command line agruments
......"Most" legitimate user applications like Adobe, Web browsers, etc. don't spawn child processes like cmd.exe. If you see this, they should be investigated.
......Core Windows processes shouldn't be communicating out to the internet. If you see communication from these processes, dig deeper. Look for suspicious URLs/IPs, check process strings, etc.
......Leverage memory analysis to detect hidden and/or injected process. Some malware can hide processes by unlinking them (among other ways). Memory analysis is a must these days.

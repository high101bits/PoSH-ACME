Do the connections/ports used make sense?
--- Should two ephemeral ports be talking
--- Is a client machine using a well known port (acting like a server)?
--- Is there an established connection to a suspicious resource (known bad IP, domain name)
Ephemeral ports are created by the operating system as a temporary client endpoint when establishing IP communications.

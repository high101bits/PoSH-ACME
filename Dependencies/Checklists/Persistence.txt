Persistence is a way for applications to automatically be run after the system boots
Malware often has a persistence mechanism so that the malware will run on reboot
The following locations are commonly used for persistence:
--- Scheduled tasks (Kernel 6.x+ comes pre-configured with many jobs making it easier for an adversary to blend in)
--- Registry RunKeys
--- Services (Check load order if bootlog is enabled)
--- DLL Search Order Hijacking
--- Shortcut Hijacking

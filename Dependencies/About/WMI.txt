Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

By default, WMI (RPC/DCOM) uses a randomly selected TCP port between 1024 and 65535. The ports that are used by WMI discovery methods and the corresponding assigned ports are described in the following table.
    Port Number         Port assignment
    -----------         ---------------
    135                 DCE RPC Endpoint Manager, DCOM Service Control
    1024-1030           Restricted DCOM
    49152-65535         Unrestricted DCOM
    139                 Netbios Session Service
    445                 Microsoft Directory Services SMB

Starting in PowerShell 3.0, this cmdlet has been superseded by Get-CimInstance.
The Get-WmiObject cmdlet gets instances of WMI classes or information about the available WMI classes. To specify a remote computer, use the ComputerName parameter. If the List parameter is specified, the cmdlet gets information about the WMI classes that are available in a specified namespace. If the Query parameter is specified, the cmdlet runs a WMI query language (WQL) statement.
The Get-WmiObject cmdlet does not use Windows PowerShell remoting to perform remote operations. You can use the ComputerName parameter of the Get-WmiObject cmdlet even if your computer does not meet the requirements for Windows PowerShell remoting or is not configured for remoting in Windows PowerShell.

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the __Server property of the object that Get-WmiObject returns has a PSComputerName alias. This makes it easier to include the source computer name in output and reports.
The Invoke-WmiMethod cmdlet calls the methods of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
New Common Information Model (CIM) cmdlets, introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0, perform the same tasks as the WMI cmdlets. The CIM cmdlets comply with WS-Management (WSMan) standards and with the CIM standard, which enables the cmdlets to use the same techniques to manage Windows computers and those running other operating systems. Instead of using Invoke-WmiMethod, consider using Invoke-CimMethod.

WMI is an integrated part of the Windows operating system, and since Windows 2000 it has come pre-installed with all Windows operating systems. WMI is built as a series of components:
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a subsystem of PowerShell that gives admins access to powerful system monitoring tools. Though this system has been designed to allow for fast, efficient system administration, it also has a spookier side: it can be abused by insiders as a tool to surveil other employees. This can be extremely useful in detecting and defeating insider threats.

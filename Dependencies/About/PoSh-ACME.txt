PoSh-ACME is a tool that allows you to run any number of queries against any number
of hosts. The queries primarily consist of one liner commands, but several are made
of scripts that allows for obtaining data on older systems like Server 2008 R2 where
newer commands are not supported. PoSh-ACME consists of queries speicific for hosts
and servers, workgroups and domains, registry and Event Logs. It provides a simple
way to view data in CSV format using PowerShell's built in Out-GridView, as well as
displays the data in various chart formats. Other add-on features includes a spread
of external applications like various Sysinternals tools, and basic reference info
for quick use when not on the web.

As the name indicates, PoSh-ACME is writen in PowerShell. The GUI is built using the
.NET Framework and its forms library.

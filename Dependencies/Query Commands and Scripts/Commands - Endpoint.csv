A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads that exeucte instructions concurrently. It contains the program code and its activity. The list of legitimate, non-malicious processes will largely depend on the operating system and software installed on the endpoiint.

Several techniques exists to determine if a process is malicious or not, for example:
     1) Malware often uses common executable names for obfuscation. In this case, you can check the file locaiton of the process. For example, the svchost.exe process should only be launched from the C:\Windows\System32 directory.
     2) Malware can use advance techniques like 'process hollowing', where a legitamate process is loaded on the system solely to act as a container for malicious code. In this case, you can use known established Windows internals for aide. For example, only services.exe can launch legit a svchost.exe process, so any svchost.exe with a differing parent process is malicious.
     3) Some processes should have only one instance running like services.exe and lsass.exe.",Processes

A service is a program that is often automatically started upon boot or through some other means, and is generally used for programs that run in the background. One place to look for malware is in the operating system's services to see if there is a service that does not belong and could be loading the infection.

A service is loaded on startup by either 1) Windows directly launching an application or 2) by using svchost.exe.
     1) If a service is loaded directly by Windows, the associated filename that launches the service can be found in the ImagePath value under the following registry entry: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<servicename>. 
     2) If a service is being launched by svchost.exe, it will be placed in a particular service group, which is then launched by svchost.exe. A listing of these groups and the services that are launched under them can be found under the following registry entry: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost. Under this key you will find various groups (netsvcs, LocalServices, etc) in which each contain multiple services that will be launched when the group is loaded by svchost.exe. These groups are loaded by the following command: svchost.exe -k netsvcs. It will load all the services found under the netsvcs group in the above key and appear as one process under the process list. So each time a new group is loaded by svchost.exe, you will find a new svchost.exe process listed in memory. It is for this reason why there are multiple svchost.exe processes listed on a machine. You can see what services each svchost.exe process is controlling with the following command: tasklist /SVC. When a service is launched in the way, the actual filename for the service can be found here: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<servicename>\Parameters\\ServiceDLL. The value of Service DLL is the actual service file that we want to be concerned with.

Service entries are stored in the registry under a section called ControlSet. A ControlSet is located under the following registry key: HKLM\SYSTEM. A ControlSet is a complete copy of the configuration that is used to successfully launch services, other critical files, and drives for Windows. When you look under the above key there will always be at least two ControlSets and one CurrentControlSet. One of these numbered control sets refers to the default configuration that is used when the computer normally boots. The other numbered control set refers to the one used when you choose to boot up using the Last Known Good Configuration. The last one, CurrentControlSet, is an exact mirror of the ControlSet used to boot into Windows, so that if you make a change, CurrentControlSet will automatically appear in the ControlSet it is mirroring and vice-versa. If you want to know for sure which ControlSet the CurrentControlSet is pointing to you can examine the following registry key: HKLM\SYSTEM\Select. This key gives us important information as to which ControlSet was used on the last boot, which is used by default, and which is designated for LastKnownGoodConfiguration.

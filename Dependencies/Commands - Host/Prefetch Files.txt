Prefetch Files
====================================================================================================
   Prefetch files are great artifacts for investigators trying to analyze applications
that have been run on a system. Windows creates a prefetch file when an application is
run from a particular location for the very first time. This is used to help speed up
the loading of applications. Prefetch is enabled on Windows desktop by default, but not
on servers.

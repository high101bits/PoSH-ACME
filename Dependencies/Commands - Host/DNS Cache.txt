DNS Cache
====================================================================================================
   A DNS Cache is a temporary database that contains records of all recently visited
and attempted visits to websites and other internet domains. Before a browser issues
its DNS request to the outside network, the computer first queries its local database.
If found, the browser uses the temporary info located inside the DNS Cache, otherwise
a DNS reqeuest is sent out for name resolution and an entry is stored temporarily.

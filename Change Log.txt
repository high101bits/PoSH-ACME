			- One to change the rolled credentials within Active Directory
		- Rolled credentials are automatically generated
			- Password Length consists of 250 random characters
			- Passowrd character set: abcdefghiklmnoprstuvwxyzABCDEFGHKLMNOPRSTUVWXYZ1234567890

Added the abiltiy to retrieve any number of files from any number of hosts
	- You first need to query for files using the 'File Search' section
		- Then click on the 'Retrieve Files' button and select one of the csv files
		- Select any number of files to download
	- Retrieved files are zipped on the target enpoint
		- to the C:\windows\temp directory
		- then copied back using WinRM (a single session for multiple files on each endpoint)
			- TO DO: Added WinRM copy function (rather than RPC) to the sysinternals section
	- Files are stored locally as a compressed/zipped files
		- Each file retrieved has metadata collected on it from the endpoint
			- File Properties (extended)
			- File Hashes of individual files (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512)
				- No hashes if downloading a directory recursively
			- Authenticode Signature Information of individual files (extended)
		- This metadata is saved within the compressed file as 'file details.txt'
	- This establishes a PSSession to each endpoint for the duration of the file copies
		- automatically closes each PSSessions after the last file is copied from each endpoint
	- Button is called 'Retireve Files' and is located in the Main Tab Section beneath 'Analyst Options'
	- Reorganized the buttons in the Main Tab section
